# Markdown Rust
Fast, simple, distraction free Markdown editor.

## Motivation
There seem to be no simple, fast Markdown editors on Linux. Most of them are built with some version of Chrome and Javascript.

This project is inspired by [uberwriter](http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/).

## Development

Build:

    cargo build

Run:

    ./target/debug/markdown-rs
